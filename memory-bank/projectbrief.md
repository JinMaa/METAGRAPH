# Runestone Visualizer Project Brief

## Project Overview
Runestone Visualizer is a specialized explorer and visualization tool for the Alkanes protocol built on Bitcoin. It provides a developer-friendly interface for interacting with the Metashrew API, exploring Alkanes functions, testing RPC methods, and visualizing blockchain data.

## Core Objectives
1. **Simplified API Access**: Provide an intuitive interface for Metashrew API access without requiring deep blockchain knowledge
2. **Method Documentation**: Offer comprehensive documentation for all available API methods
3. **Interactive Testing**: Enable developers to test API calls directly from the browser
4. **Endpoint Flexibility**: Support both local development and production endpoints
5. **Visualization**: Present complex blockchain data in easily understandable visualizations

## Target Users
- Alkanes developers building on the platform
- Blockchain researchers investigating Alkanes functionality
- Technical users exploring the capabilities of Bitcoin protocols

## Key Success Metrics
- Intuitive and responsive user interface
- Comprehensive method documentation
- Reliable API connectivity
- Clear visualization of complex blockchain data

## Technical Requirements
- Lightweight HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation (no heavy frameworks)
- Mobile and desktop responsive design
- Fast loading times with minimal dependencies
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Design Philosophy
The project follows a "bare metal" approach with:
1. Vanilla JavaScript for core functionality
2. Minimal external dependencies
3. Modular design for easy maintenance
4. Progressive enhancement for accessibility

## Development Timeline
The project is in active development with ongoing improvements to:
- API method documentation
- Visualization capabilities
- Error handling robustness
- Performance optimization

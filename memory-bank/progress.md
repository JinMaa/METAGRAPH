## Known Issues

### 1. Browser Compatibility
- Some Node.js features are not fully compatible with the browser environment
- Buffer implementation is limited and may not handle all cases
- File system operations are mocked and don't persist data

### 2. Error Handling
- Some error messages could be more user-friendly
- Error recovery could be improved in some components
- Network errors need better handling and retry mechanisms

### 3. Performance
- Large result sets can cause performance issues
- Some API calls to mainnet can be slow
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data

### 4. UI/UX
- Loading states could be improved
- Form validation needs enhancement
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement
- Some links may not work correctly if routes are not properly defined

## Recent Achievements

1. **Implemented Trace Method Page**: Successfully implemented a dedicated page for the "trace" API method with proper examples, documentation, and functionality.

2. **Improved Application Architecture**: Enhanced the application architecture to better use React Router and create a more consistent user experience.

3. **Fixed Home Page Issues**: Resolved issues with the home page by merging the design from App.jsx with the functionality from Home.jsx.

4. **Enhanced Component Reusability**: Improved the APIForm component to support examples and notes sections, making it more reusable across different API methods.

5. **Updated SDK Implementation**: Updated the traceTransaction function in the SDK to correctly use the AlkanesRpc trace method.

6. **Removed Mock Data**: Successfully removed all mock data from the application and implemented real data fetching through the Oyl SDK.

7. **Browser Compatibility**: Implemented a comprehensive Node.js compatibility layer that allows the Oyl SDK to run in a browser environment.

8. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the application, with better error messages and recovery mechanisms.

9. **Provider Implementation**: Enhanced the provider implementation to handle different network environments and provide a consistent interface.

10. **Alkanes API Methods**: Implemented all core Alkanes API methods with proper error handling and response formatting.

## Next Priorities

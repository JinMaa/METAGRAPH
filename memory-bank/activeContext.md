# METHANE Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing new API method pages and improving the application's architecture. We're working on properly integrating the Oyl SDK into the METHANE application, implementing new API methods like the trace method, and enhancing the overall user experience through better routing and UI design.

## Recent Changes

### 1. Trace Method Implementation

We've implemented a dedicated page for the "trace" API method that visualizes and allows testing of transaction execution traces:

- Updated `src/sdk/alkanes.js` to correctly implement the `traceTransaction` function using the AlkanesRpc trace method
- Created a dedicated `TraceForm.jsx` component for the trace method page
- Enhanced the `APIForm.jsx` component to support examples and notes sections
- Added proper routing for the trace method page
- Implemented the UI according to the design specifications

### 2. Application Architecture Improvements

We've improved the application architecture to better use React Router and create a more consistent user experience:

- Updated `main.jsx` to use React Router with the RouterProvider
- Modified `App.jsx` to use React Router's Outlet component and serve as the root layout
- Updated `Home.jsx` to match the design from App.jsx while using proper React Router links
- Updated `routes.jsx` to use App.jsx as the root layout component
- Ensured proper context passing between components

### 3. Node.js Compatibility Layer Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive Node.js compatibility layer to allow the Oyl SDK (which was designed for Node.js) to run in a browser environment:

- Created `src/sdk/node-shims.js` to provide browser-compatible implementations of Node.js-specific features
- Added shims for:
  - `process` object with properties like `version`, `cwd()`, and `env`
  - `fs` module with basic file system operations
  - `path` module with path manipulation utilities
  - `global` object
  - `Buffer` implementation

This approach allows us to use the Oyl SDK without modifying its source code, making future updates easier.

### 4. Provider Implementation Improvements

We've enhanced the provider implementation to handle errors more gracefully and avoid using mock data:

- Updated `src/sdk/provider.js` to import Node.js shims before any other imports
- Implemented a proxy for the sandshrew client to handle missing methods
- Removed fallback to mock data in error cases
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Implemented real health check and block height methods

### 5. Alkanes API Methods Implementation

We've updated the Alkanes API methods to use real data and handle errors properly:

- Updated `src/sdk/alkanes.js` to import Node.js shims
- Added validation to ensure required methods exist before calling them
- Implemented proper error handling for all methods
- Removed mock data fallbacks
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 6. Error Handling Improvements

We've implemented a more robust error handling strategy:

- Added retry mechanism in the BlockHeight component
- Improved error messages to be more user-friendly
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Ensured errors are properly propagated to the UI

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Component Structure and Reusability

We've adopted a component structure that promotes reusability:

- Created a template component (`APIForm.jsx`) that can be reused for all API methods
- Implemented method-specific components that use the template component
- Ensured consistent styling and behavior across all method pages

### 2. Routing Architecture

We've implemented a routing architecture that:

- Uses App.jsx as the root layout component
- Passes the endpoint context to child routes
- Ensures proper route matching for API method pages
- Provides a consistent user experience across the application

### 3. Browser Compatibility Approach

We decided to implement custom Node.js shims rather than modifying the Oyl SDK or using a different library. This decision was made because:

- It allows us to use the official Oyl SDK without modifications
- It provides more control over the compatibility layer
- It's more maintainable as the SDK evolves
- It's a cleaner solution than trying to modify the SDK

### 4. Error Handling Strategy

We decided to handle errors at multiple levels:

- SDK level: Catch and log errors, return structured error responses
- Component level: Display user-friendly error messages, implement retry mechanisms
- Application level: Prevent crashes with error boundaries

This multi-layered approach ensures that errors are handled appropriately at each level of the application.

### 5. Network Configuration

We're supporting three network environments:

- Mainnet: For production use with real Bitcoin
- Regtest: For local development and testing
- Oylnet: For testing with a more stable testnet

Each environment has its own configuration and can be selected at runtime.

### 6. Performance Considerations

We're implementing several strategies to address performance concerns:

- Limiting the number of transactions processed in block tracing
- Adding validation before making API calls
- Implementing retry mechanisms with backoff
- Providing clear feedback during long-running operations

## Next Steps

### 1. Implement Additional API Methods

- Implement remaining API methods from the method matrix
- Ensure consistent design and behavior across all method pages
- Add comprehensive documentation for each method

### 2. Enhance User Experience

- Improve navigation between method pages
- Add more interactive examples
- Implement better error handling and feedback
- Add pagination for methods that return large datasets

### 3. Complete Integration Testing

- Test all API methods with real data
- Verify error handling works as expected
- Test performance with large datasets
- Test across different network environments

### 4. UI Improvements

- Enhance loading states for better user experience
- Improve error message display
- Add more contextual help for users
- Implement responsive design improvements

### 5. Documentation Updates

- Update API method documentation with real examples
- Add troubleshooting guides for common errors
- Document the integration approach for other developers
- Create tutorials for common use cases

### 6. Additional Features

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add export functionality for API responses
- Implement search functionality for method pages
- Add user preferences for default network and other settings

## Key Insights

1. **React Router Integration**: Properly integrating React Router is crucial for a consistent user experience. Using the Outlet component and context passing ensures that components have access to the data they need.

2. **Component Reusability**: Creating reusable components like APIForm has significantly reduced code duplication and ensured consistency across method pages.

3. **Node.js to Browser Compatibility**: The most significant challenge has been making the Node.js-based Oyl SDK work in a browser environment. Our shims approach has proven effective but requires careful testing.

4. **Real vs. Mock Data**: Removing mock data has revealed several edge cases and error scenarios that weren't previously handled. This has led to more robust error handling throughout the application.

5. **API Reliability**: Different network environments have different reliability characteristics. Mainnet is more stable but slower, while regtest is faster but requires local setup.

6. **Developer Experience**: The application needs to provide clear feedback and guidance to developers, especially when errors occur. This includes both UI feedback and detailed logging.

7. **Performance Tradeoffs**: There's a balance between providing comprehensive data and maintaining good performance. We're implementing strategies like pagination and limiting dataset size to address this.

## Known Issues

### 1. Browser Compatibility
- Some Node.js features are not fully compatible with the browser environment
- Buffer implementation is limited and may not handle all cases
- File system operations are mocked and don't persist data

### 2. Error Handling
- Some error messages could be more user-friendly
- Error recovery could be improved in some components
- Network errors need better handling and retry mechanisms

### 3. Performance
- Large result sets can cause performance issues
- Some API calls to mainnet can be slow
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data

### 4. UI/UX
- Loading states could be improved
- Form validation needs enhancement
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement

## Recent Achievements

1. **Removed Mock Data**: Successfully removed all mock data from the application and implemented real data fetching through the Oyl SDK.

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Implemented a comprehensive Node.js compatibility layer that allows the Oyl SDK to run in a browser environment.

3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the application, with better error messages and recovery mechanisms.

4. **Provider Implementation**: Enhanced the provider implementation to handle different network environments and provide a consistent interface.

5. **Alkanes API Methods**: Implemented all core Alkanes API methods with proper error handling and response formatting.

## Next Priorities

1. **Complete Testing**: Test all API methods with real data across different network environments.

2. **Enhance Documentation**: Add comprehensive documentation for all API methods and use cases.

3. **Implement Remaining Methods**: Complete the implementation of the remaining API methods from the method matrix.

4. **Improve UI/UX**: Enhance the user interface and experience with better loading states, error messages, and form validation.

5. **Optimize Performance**: Implement caching and pagination to improve performance with large datasets.

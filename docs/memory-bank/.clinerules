# Project Intelligence for Alkanes Explorer

## API Interaction Patterns

- **Field Order is Critical**: Always maintain JSON-RPC field order as `method`, `params`, `id`, `jsonrpc` - this is not just a preference but a technical requirement for the Metashrew API
- **No Project ID**: The API works better without any Project ID authentication - never add it back in the code
- **String Parsing Required**: `metashrew_height` always returns a string that must be parsed with `parseInt()`
- **Indexer Ahead**: The indexer height from `metashrew_height` will typically be 1 block ahead of `btc_getblockcount` - this is normal and expected behavior

## UI and UX Patterns

- **Collapsible Sections**: Use `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for showing complex data - they provide a clean way to hide complexity while maintaining access
- **Error Message Container**: Always display API errors in the dedicated `#error-messages` container - this maintains consistency in error reporting
- **Status Color Coding**: Use the CSS classes `status-error`, `status-warning`, and `status-success` consistently for status indicators

## Code Organization

- **API Client Centralization**: All Metashrew API calls should go through the `callMetashrewApi` function in `metashrew-api.ts` for consistent error handling
- **DOM Element Access**: Always check for null before setting properties on DOM elements - this has been a source of bugs
- **CSS Separation**: Page-specific styles should go in dedicated CSS files (e.g., `transaction-search.css`) while keeping common styles in `minimal.css`

## Documentation Standards

- **Memory Bank Structure**: Follow the established memory bank hierarchy for all documentation
- **Navigation Links**: When documenting files, include direct file:/// links to make navigation easier
- **Status Indicators**: Use emoji in documentation to indicate status (âœ… complete, ðŸŸ¡ in progress, âšª not started)

## Development Workflow

- **Test After Removal**: Always test functionality after removing any reference to the Sandshrew Project ID
- **Server Restart Required**: The server needs to be restarted to pick up changes to TypeScript files after recompilation
- **Browser Cache**: Sometimes the browser cache needs to be cleared to see CSS and JavaScript changes

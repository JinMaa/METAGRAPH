## Known Issues

### 1. Browser Compatibility
- Some Node.js features are not fully compatible with the browser environment
- Buffer implementation is limited and may not handle all cases
- File system operations are mocked and don't persist data

### 2. Error Handling
- Some error messages could be more user-friendly
- Error recovery could be improved in some components
- Network errors need better handling and retry mechanisms
- Wallet connection errors need specific handling

### 3. Performance
- Large result sets can cause performance issues
- Some API calls to mainnet can be slow
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
- LaserEyesProvider may impact initial load time

### 4. UI/UX
- Loading states could be improved
- Form validation needs enhancement
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement
- Some links may not work correctly if routes are not properly defined

# METHANE Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on properly integrating the Oyl SDK into the METHANE application, specifically addressing issues with mock data and ensuring real data is used throughout the application. This work is critical for the application to function as intended and provide real value to users.

## Recent Changes

### 1. Node.js Compatibility Layer Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive Node.js compatibility layer to allow the Oyl SDK (which was designed for Node.js) to run in a browser environment:

- Created `src/sdk/node-shims.js` to provide browser-compatible implementations of Node.js-specific features
- Added shims for:
  - `process` object with properties like `version`, `cwd()`, and `env`
  - `fs` module with basic file system operations
  - `path` module with path manipulation utilities
  - `global` object
  - `Buffer` implementation

This approach allows us to use the Oyl SDK without modifying its source code, making future updates easier.

### 2. Provider Implementation Improvements

We've enhanced the provider implementation to handle errors more gracefully and avoid using mock data:

- Updated `src/sdk/provider.js` to import Node.js shims before any other imports
- Implemented a proxy for the sandshrew client to handle missing methods
- Removed fallback to mock data in error cases
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Implemented real health check and block height methods

### 3. Alkanes API Methods Implementation

We've updated the Alkanes API methods to use real data and handle errors properly:

- Updated `src/sdk/alkanes.js` to import Node.js shims
- Added validation to ensure required methods exist before calling them
- Implemented proper error handling for all methods
- Removed mock data fallbacks
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4. Error Handling Improvements

We've implemented a more robust error handling strategy:

- Added retry mechanism in the BlockHeight component
- Improved error messages to be more user-friendly
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Ensured errors are properly propagated to the UI

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Browser Compatibility Approach

We decided to implement custom Node.js shims rather than modifying the Oyl SDK or using a different library. This decision was made because:

- It allows us to use the official Oyl SDK without modifications
- It provides more control over the compatibility layer
- It's more maintainable as the SDK evolves
- It's a cleaner solution than trying to modify the SDK

### 2. Error Handling Strategy

We decided to handle errors at multiple levels:

- SDK level: Catch and log errors, return structured error responses
- Component level: Display user-friendly error messages, implement retry mechanisms
- Application level: Prevent crashes with error boundaries

This multi-layered approach ensures that errors are handled appropriately at each level of the application.

### 3. Network Configuration

We're supporting three network environments:

- Mainnet: For production use with real Bitcoin
- Regtest: For local development and testing
- Oylnet: For testing with a more stable testnet

Each environment has its own configuration and can be selected at runtime.

### 4. Performance Considerations

We're implementing several strategies to address performance concerns:

- Limiting the number of transactions processed in block tracing
- Adding validation before making API calls
- Implementing retry mechanisms with backoff
- Providing clear feedback during long-running operations

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Integration Testing

- Test all API methods with real data
- Verify error handling works as expected
- Test performance with large datasets
- Test across different network environments

### 2. UI Improvements

- Enhance loading states for better user experience
- Improve error message display
- Add more contextual help for users
- Implement responsive design improvements

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Update API method documentation with real examples
- Add troubleshooting guides for common errors
- Document the integration approach for other developers
- Create tutorials for common use cases

### 4. Additional Features

- Implement remaining API methods from the method matrix
- Add pagination for methods that return large datasets
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add export functionality for API responses

## Key Insights

1. **Node.js to Browser Compatibility**: The most significant challenge has been making the Node.js-based Oyl SDK work in a browser environment. Our shims approach has proven effective but requires careful testing.

2. **Real vs. Mock Data**: Removing mock data has revealed several edge cases and error scenarios that weren't previously handled. This has led to more robust error handling throughout the application.

3. **API Reliability**: Different network environments have different reliability characteristics. Mainnet is more stable but slower, while regtest is faster but requires local setup.

4. **Developer Experience**: The application needs to provide clear feedback and guidance to developers, especially when errors occur. This includes both UI feedback and detailed logging.

5. **Performance Tradeoffs**: There's a balance between providing comprehensive data and maintaining good performance. We're implementing strategies like pagination and limiting dataset size to address this.

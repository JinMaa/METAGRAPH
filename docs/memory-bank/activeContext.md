# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on enhancing and stabilizing the API status display functionality. Recent work has centered on:

1. Complete removal of Sandshrew Project ID references from the codebase
2. UI improvements for displaying API status information
3. Error handling for API connections
4. Proper formatting of JSON-RPC requests

## Recent Changes

### API Integration
- Removed all references to Sandshrew Project ID across the codebase
- Updated API calls to follow the correct JSON-RPC format:
  - Proper field order: `method`, `params`, `id`, `jsonrpc`
  - Fixed numerical IDs instead of timestamps
  - Content-Type only headers
- Fixed endpoint URLs to use `lasereyes` instead of `subfrost`

### UI Enhancements
- Redesigned API status section with collapsible details
- Created a dedicated error message container
- Improved status indicators with clear success/error states
- Enhanced CSS styling for better readability and organization

## Active Decisions

### API Strategy
- **Decision**: Do not use Sandshrew Project ID for any API calls
- **Rationale**: Testing confirmed that the API works better without authentication
- **Implementation**: Removed all references to Project ID in headers and env variables

### Error Handling
- **Decision**: Display detailed error messages directly in the UI
- **Rationale**: Helps users troubleshoot API connection issues
- **Implementation**: Added error message container and error reporting system

### UI Layout
- **Decision**: Use collapsible sections for detailed information
- **Rationale**: Keeps UI clean while allowing access to detailed data
- **Implementation**: Implemented details/summary elements with proper styling

## Current Considerations

### Testing Requirements
- Need comprehensive testing of all API method pages
- Verify that removed Project ID doesn't affect any functionality
- Confirm that error handling works correctly across all pages

### Potential Improvements
- Consider adding caching for API responses to reduce load
- Improve navigation between related entities (blocks → transactions → traces)
- Add visual indicators for API response times
- Implement batch loading with sandshrew_multicall for performance

### Known Issues
- JavaScript errors might occur when API returns unexpected formats
- DOM element access needs better null checking
- Error messages could be more specific and actionable
- Some complex API responses need better formatting

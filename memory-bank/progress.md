# Progress

## Project Status Overview
As of March 14, 2025, the Alkanes Explorer project is ready for open-source release. We have successfully implemented all core functionality including the API Explorer interface, method documentation with interactive testing, and comprehensive documentation for contributors. The project now includes all necessary open-source components and follows best practices for community engagement.

## What Works
### Core Functionality

- âœ… Block height display with node and indexer heights
- âœ… Automatic refresh of API status
- âœ… Manual refresh option for API status
- âœ… Event-based communication between components
- âœ… Standardized API method page template

### API Integration
- âœ… Connection to Metashrew API with proper headers
- âœ… Efficient error handling with retries and timeouts
- âœ… Batch processing with sandshrew_multicall

## Current Status: Ready for Open Source
The project is now ready for open-source release with all essential components in place. The core API Explorer functionality is working correctly with both local and production endpoints. The endpoint toggle has been implemented across the API method pages, and a standardized template has been created for future method additions.

### Major Achievements
1. **API Integration Improvements**
   - Removed dependence on `X-Sandshrew-Project-ID` header for better reliability
   - Standardized JSON-RPC request format with proper field order
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling with fallbacks

2. **Documentation Standardization**
   - Created unified API method documentation template
   - Standardized curl examples following best practices
   - Added clear parameter descriptions and return value documentation

3. **Open Source Essentials**
   - Added all required legal and contribution documents
   - Created comprehensive developer guides
   - Implemented security disclosure process

4. **Code Improvements**
   - Enhanced endpoint toggle component with status display
   - Improved API client with better error handling
   - Updated package.json with proper metadata and dependencies

## Timeline and Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Core API Explorer | Completed | âœ… Done | Basic API method documentation and testing |
| Endpoint Toggle | Completed | âœ… Done | Switch between local and production APIs |
| Open Source Preparation | March 14, 2025 | âœ… Done | All required docs and infrastructure |
| Public Release | March 21, 2025 | ðŸ”² Pending | Final testing and repository setup |
| GraphQL API Layer | April 2025 | ðŸ”² Planned | Schema and resolvers for efficient data fetching |
| Advanced Visualizations | May 2025 | ðŸ”² Planned | Enhanced trace and transaction visualizations |

## Known Issues
1. **API Request Timeouts**: In some cases, requests to the Metashrew API may time out, especially for complex calls like trace and traceblock. We've implemented retry logic, but this could be further improved.

2. **Limited Test Coverage**: While the core functionality works, we still need comprehensive tests to ensure everything works as expected across different environments.

3. **Missing Advanced Features**: Some advanced features like transaction trace visualization and contract call decoding are still in the planning phase.

## Next Steps for Release
1. **Final Testing**
   - Test all API method pages with both local and production endpoints
   - Verify the endpoint toggle works correctly across all pages
   - Test on different browsers and devices

2. **Repository Setup**
   - Create GitHub repository with proper settings
   - Configure branch protection rules
   - Set up issue templates

3. **Release Announcement**
   - Prepare blog post or announcement
   - Create demo video showcasing key features
   - Set up community channels for support and discussion

## Future Roadmap
1. **Q2 2025**
   - Implement GraphQL API layer
   - Add comprehensive test suite
   - Create Docker configuration for deployment

2. **Q3 2025**
   - Implement advanced visualizations
   - Add support for additional blockchain networks
   - Create plugin system for extensions

3. **Q4 2025**
   - Implement analytics and monitoring
   - Add support for custom Alkanes contracts
   - Create developer SDK for integration

This progress report will be updated as we continue to develop and enhance the Alkanes Explorer.
